# Predation Simulation Exercise

This Python script simulates the interaction between prey and predators based on certain parameters, conducting a population simulation over a specified duration.

## Overview

The script involves classes representing prey (`Proie`) and predators (`Predateur`). It includes functions for their behavior, reproduction, encounter scenarios, and population dynamics. The simulation runs over a set number of time steps, allowing observation of population changes based on varying conditions.

## Execution

The script is organized into sections addressing different questions. It uses class definitions, functions, loops, and data visualization using Matplotlib.

## Usage

The code can be run in a Python environment. Each section corresponds to a specific question or scenario as part of the exercise, analyzing the impact of changing parameters on prey-predator populations.

## Sections

The script is divided into sections addressing the following aspects:

- **Setup**: Definition of classes (`Proie`, `Predateur`) and their behaviors.
- **Population Simulation**: Simulates population dynamics over a specified duration.
- **Visualizations**: Uses Matplotlib to visualize population changes based on different parameters.
- **Experiments**: Conducts experiments by altering specific parameters and observing their effects on population dynamics.

## Running the Code

1. Run the script in a Python environment or Jupyter Notebook.
2. Observe the output for different experiments altering prey-predator population parameters.
3. Analyze the visualizations to understand the impact of varied conditions on population behavior.

Feel free to modify parameters or conduct additional experiments to explore different scenarios and observe population dynamics.
